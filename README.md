# Ophelia

A Rust reimplementation of the Jinja2 templating system.

## Start here

You can use the `ophelia2` package on PyPI as a drop-in replacement for `jinja`. Note that unlike
the Pallets project, I care less for older versions of the Python interpreter; although we don't
actively try to break support for older Python versions, support for these Python versions is not an
explicit goal. Please try to use a recent version of the `cpython` virtual machine.

That's pretty much all there is to say if you just want faster template rendering. You may also want
to look at the `ophelia_flask_patch` package, which will adjust the Flask web framework to render
templates using Ophelia.

I confess, this hasn't been written yet.
